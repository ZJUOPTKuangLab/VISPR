# VISPR
The VISPR (vectorial in-situ point spread function (PSF) retrieval) is a method that retrieves a precise in-situ 3D PSF model considering both system and sample-induced aberrations under Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) conditions. In this repository, source codes including simulation and experiment, some example data and localization analysis using the PSF models generated from VISPR.
